# TicKatToe 
I thought this would be a fun project to continue my Javascript/web development learning.

I had also taken an Artificial Intelligence class and a Game Theory class in college that I had found very interesting, so this seemed like a fun way to combine both of those classes while I practice. 

I based this project off of the open source project at https://github.com/Mostafa-Samir/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI.  This was only a 3x3 game, but I sought to expand it and make it more challengeing to myself by extending it to a 4x4 game.

This project gave me the opprotunity to practice my Javascript, practice expanding on existing open soure projects, and practice my Aritifical Intelligence and Game Theory skills.

Eventually, I hope to include a database that can keep track of the times a user has beaten each of the AIs.  I also intend to create different levels of AIs.  Another goal for this project is to have a 2-player game.  I will also probably include the 3x3 game that was originally created by Mostafa-Samir.
